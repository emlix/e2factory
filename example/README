The example/ subdirectory includes an example project configuration.

You can easily set up the example project by running

 $ make fetch

to fetch files required to setup the example and

 $ make install_example

to install files required for the the example project to your server
environment and setup the example project.
If you change the LOCALSTATEDIR setting in your e2factory build make sure
you use the same setting here.

Finally you can checkout the project

 $ e2-fetch-project e2factory-example
 $ cd e2factory-example

and use it...

 $ e2-ls-project
 $ e2-fetch-sources
 $ e2-build
