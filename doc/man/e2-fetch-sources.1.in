.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
e2-fetch-sources [<option> ... | <source> ... | <result> ...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBe2-fetch-sources\fR is part of the e2factory commandline tools.
\fBe2-fetch-sources\fR can operate in two modes, fetch and update.

The \fBfetch\fR mode retrieves sources. Sources can be
either specified through the source- or result names. Sources stored
in SCM repositories will be cloned and a project-local working copy
will be created. Already fetched source are not updated in the
\fBfetch\fR mode. See below.

The \fBupdate\fR mode is currently limited to the git SCM and updates
remote branches without touching the working-copy. That way additional
