.SH NAME

.SH DESCRIPTION
The mandatory files \fBres/<dir>/config\fR configure results to be built. The name of
the directory \fB<dir>\fR defines the result-name.
In case of sub-directories, all directories below \fBres/\fR do form the
result-name separated by dots.

e.g.:
\fBres/<name1>/<name2>/config\fR leads to result name: \fB<name1>.<name2>\fR.
