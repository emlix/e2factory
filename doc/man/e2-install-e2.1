.SH NAME
e2-install-e2 \- install the e2 local tools into a project environment

.SH SYNOPSIS
e2-install-e2

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBe2-install-e2\fR reads the required e2 version from the
\fB.e2/e2version\fR file and installs that version of e2 into the local
project environment.

The \fB.e2/e2version\fR file has a single line with this format:

 <branch> <tag>

By default the tagged version of e2 is installed.

To enable the project developers to follow a stable branch of the
e2 local tools, the tag may be ^ unless a release shall be built.
In this case the HEAD of the branch is installed. In this case
the e2 local tools change if commits are done to that branch.

That is analog to source configurations in the project repository.
