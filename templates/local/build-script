# e2factory build script template
#
# The build system provides the following variables for use in build scripts:
# - E2_TMPDIR       pointing to a temporary directory with a directory 
#                   structure
# - E2_RESULT       the name of the result currently building
# - E2_BUILD_NUMBER the build number, 0 by default
#
# Additional variables can be provided in init files.
# Variables are not exported unless the init files do.
#
# The following directory structure is available, relative to E2_TMPDIR
#

# 			installing software for packaging

# 			script
