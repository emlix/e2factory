INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

First make sure that the following packages are installed in your system

  make
  gcc
  git (1.6.6+)
  rsync (3.0.4+)
  curl
  cvs (optional)
  subversion (optional)

More packages are required but usually installed by default.

e2factory uses a unix group named ebs by default. All users of e2factory
must belong to that group. Create the group.

  groupadd ebs

Be sure to add yourself to that group.

To install e2factory, enter the following commands while
being located in the toplevel source directory (the directory
where this file can be found):

  make all
  sudo make install

This will install the global tools in PREFIX/bin, PREFIX/lib, ....
PREFIX defaults to "/usr/local" can be overridden by passing
"PREFIX" to the "make" invocations given above:

  make PREFIX=$HOME/my-e2 all
  sudo make PREFIX=$HOME/my-e2 install

(Note that the same prefix has also to be given in the install
step)

The installation step HAS to be done as root, as some global tools
need to have their setuid(1) bit set to create and remove the
chroot(1) environment.

To build and install the documentation use the doc and install-doc targets:

  make doc
  make install-doc

In case you have any problems with the installation, please
contact the e2factory team via the mailinglist:

  e2factory-users@lists.e2factory.org

with a description of your problem and the version of e2factory
that you are using.
