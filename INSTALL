INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

First make sure that the following packages are installed in your system

  make
  gcc
  git-core
  rsync
  cvs (optional)
  subversion (optional)

More packages are required but usually installed by default.

e2factory uses a unix group named ebs by default. All users of e2factory
must belong to that group. Create the group.

  groupadd ebs

Be sure to add yourself to that group.

e2factory, for historical reasons, builds and installs its own lua.
Make sure you download the lua-5.1.3.tar.gz package and place it in
the top level of the e2factory source tree prior to building. That
can be done by creating a symlink.

  ln -s ../lua-5.1.3.tar.gz

To install e2factory, enter the following commands while
being located in the toplevel source directory (the directory
where this file can be found):

  make all
  sudo make install

This will install the global tools in PREFIX/bin, PREFIX/lib, ....
PREFIX defaults to "/usr/local" can be overridden by passing
"PREFIX" to the "make" invocations given above:

  make PREFIX=$HOME/my-e2 all
  sudo make PREFIX=$HOME/my-e2 install

(Note that the same prefix has also to be given in the install
step)

The installation step HAS to be done as root, as some global tools
need to have their setuid(1) bit set to create and remove the
chroot(1) environment.

To build the documentation a few tools must be available:
  luadoc (http://luadoc.luaforge.net)
  man2html (http://users.actrix.gen.nz/michael/vhman2html.html)
  markdown (http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown)

To build and install the documentation use the doc and install-doc targets:

  make doc
  make install-doc

This will build and install the tutorial, the html manual pages and the
luadoc source code documentation.

The example/ subdirectory holds an example project. Read example/README
for more information.

In case you have any problems with the installation, please
contact the e2factory team via the mailinglist:

  e2factory-users@lists.e2factory.org

with a description of your problem and the version of e2factory
that you are using.
